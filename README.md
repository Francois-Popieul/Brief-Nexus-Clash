# Nexus Clash

**Nexus Clash** is a front-end web development project created as part of my JavaScript/TypeScript training at Simplon Grenoble. This solo project involved designing a user interface prototype using Figma before implementing it with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 🎨 Design Process

The initial design was created using **Figma**, focusing on layout, user experience, and visual consistency. The final implementation closely follows the mockup to ensure fidelity between design and development.
